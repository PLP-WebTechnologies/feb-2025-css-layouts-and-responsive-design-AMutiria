            <h2>Breakfast Pancakes</h2>
            <img src="pancakes.jpg" alt="Pancakes Image">
            <p>This is a simple recipe for making delicious pancakes for breakfast. A healthy and heartwarming meal to start your day.</p>
            <div class="recipe-details">
                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted (plus more for greasing the pan)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt until well combined. This helps distribute the leavening agent evenly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the milk and the egg until just combined. Then, whisk in the melted butter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. <strong>Be careful not to overmix.</strong> A few lumps are okay; overmixing develops gluten, which can make the pancakes tough.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heat the Pan:</strong> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. The pan is ready when a few drops of water sizzle and evaporate quickly. You can also test with a tiny dollop of batter – it should sizzle gently and turn golden brown in about 1-2 minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cook the Pancakes:</strong> Pour about ¼ cup of batter onto the hot griddle or pan for each pancake. Cook for 1-3 minutes per side, or until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set. Flip the pancakes carefully with a thin spatula when the bubbles start to pop and the bottom is golden brown.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cook the Other Side:</strong> Cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep Warm (Optional):</strong> If you're making a large batch, you can keep the cooked pancakes warm in a preheated oven (around 200°F or 95°C) on a baking sheet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve hot with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, butter, fresh fruit, whipped cream, chocolate chips, or anything else you desire!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Enjoy your homemade pancakes!</p>

            <div class="recipe-details">
                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                    <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
                    <li>1 green bell pepper, sliced</li>
                    <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon cumin</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)</li>
                    <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
                    <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>4-6 large eggs</li>
                    <li>Fresh parsley or cilantro, chopped (for garnish)</li>
                    <li>Crusty bread, for serving</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Sauté Vegetables:</strong> Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet (cast iron is ideal) over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Peppers and Garlic:</strong> Add the sliced red and green bell peppers to the skillet and cook until they start to soften, about 8-10 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Spices:</strong> Stir in the paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper (if using) and cook for about 30 seconds, stirring constantly, until fragrant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Tomatoes:</strong> Pour in the diced tomatoes (with their juice) and the tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat and let it simmer gently for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create Wells for Eggs:</strong> Using a spoon, make 4-6 small wells in the tomato sauce, spacing them evenly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crack in the Eggs:</strong> Carefully crack one egg into each well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poach the Eggs:</strong> Cover the skillet and cook over low heat for 5-10 minutes, or until the egg whites are set and the yolks are still runny (or cooked to your preference). If your skillet isn't oven-safe, you can continue cooking on the stovetop. For more evenly cooked eggs, you can also transfer the covered skillet to a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Once the eggs are cooked, remove the skillet from the heat. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley or cilantro. Serve hot directly from the skillet with plenty of crusty bread for dipping into the sauce and runny yolks.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Enjoy your flavorful Shakshuka!</p>

            <h2>Tomato Sauce Pasta</h2>
            <img src="tomato pasta.jpg" alt="Tomato Pasta Image">
            <p>A comforting and versatile dish featuring pasta coated in a savory sauce made primarily from tomatoes, often with garlic, herbs, and other flavorful additions. A widely loved and easy meal.</p>
            <div class="recipe-details">
                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound pasta (spaghetti, penne, fusilli, or your preference)</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
                    <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for a little heat)</li>
                    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>Fresh basil leaves, chopped (for garnish)</li>
                    <li>Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions until al dente (tender but still slightly firm). Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining. Drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sauté Garlic:</strong> While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Tomatoes and Spices:</strong> Pour in the crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce. Stir in the dried oregano, dried basil, and red pepper flakes (if using). Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simmer the Sauce:</strong> Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer gently for at least 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly. For a richer flavor, you can simmer it for longer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combine Pasta and Sauce:</strong> Add the cooked and drained pasta to the saucepan with the tomato sauce. Toss to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta cooking water until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the tomato pasta hot in bowls. Garnish with fresh chopped basil leaves and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Enjoy your delicious Tomato Pasta!</p>
